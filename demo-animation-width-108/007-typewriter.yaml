    Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard
    input or from a file. Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).
    Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX
    specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). Bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.
